# DDR-2014-Inori Plus
It's a mod of Inori's DDR 2014, which is a mod of Risk's DDR 2014

## Changes, Improvements, etc
- Many code rewrites
- Intense optimization so it doesn't lag as much (SSM lag is down to 5ms on i5-6300HQ)
- The Evaluation Screen has animations
- The tabs at the bottom of the eval screen act like DDR2014
- Circular animation for ScreenSelectStyle
- Custom music wheel (requires my sm fork)

## TODO
- Copy the cut-ins from DDR SN3
- A difficulty select after the music select, one that doesn't break
- EN/JP language switch
- Hide the timer if it's disabled.
- USB profile and song support.
- Remove all the lua scripts that aren't being used
- And of course... Make the perfect DDR 2014 simulator
